                    <h3>1950: The Turing Test</h3>
                    <p>Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing that if a machine can mimic human responses, it is intelligent. This set the philosophical groundwork for current AI debates.</p>

                    <p>Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a program that simulated conversation. It was the ancestor of modern LLMs, showing early on how humans easily anthropomorphize machines.</p>

                    <h3>The Media Narrative</h3>
                    <p><strong>Fear vs. Hype:</strong> Media outlets often use extreme persuasion techniques. Headlines either promise a "Utopian Future" where no one has to work, or a "Robotic Apocalypse." This polarization drives clicks but obscures the nuanced reality of gradual economic shifts.</p>

                <h3>💰 Economic Impact</h3>
                <p><strong>The "Hollow Middle":</strong> AI threatens white-collar jobs (writing, coding, analysis) more than manual labor. This could widen the wealth gap between those who own the AI and those replaced by it.</p>

                <h3>🎓 Educational Impact</h3>
                <p><strong>The "Cheating" Dilemma:</strong> Schools are forced to rethink homework. The focus is shifting from "recalling facts" (which AI does better) to "critical thinking" and "verifying sources."</p>

                <div class="solution-details">
                    <p>Instead of banning AI, we propose a regulatory framework based on three pillars:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Mandatory Disclosure:</strong> Any content (text, image, code) generated by AI must be watermarked or labeled to prevent misinformation.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Human-in-the-Loop" Laws:</strong> Critical decisions in education (grading) and employment (hiring) cannot be made solely by algorithms; a human must verify the output.</li>
                        <li><strong>Curriculum Reform:</strong> Replace "rote memorization" with "AI Literacy" — teaching students how to prompt, verify, and ethically use these tools.</li>
